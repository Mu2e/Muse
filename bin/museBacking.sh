     muse backing <backing build> <options>

     Create a link to another Muse build area to use it
     as backing build for the local build.  The linked area
     will be included in include, link, fcl and data paths,
     but it will not itself be built.

      Since this command is usually run before "muse setup",
      it must be run in the intended muse working directory

      If the command is run without any arguments, or with -l, a list
      of suggested Offline backing builds will be shown

      <backing build>
           The link selection can be presented various ways
       1) as a path to a muse working directory:
           muse backing /mu2e/app/users/\$USER/myBackingBuild
       2) a branch/commit for a continuous integration backing build:
           muse backing main/c2409d93
       3) the latest commit on the main branch from continuous integration
           muse backing HEAD
       4) a published Offline tag:
           muse backing Offline v09_10_00
               or
           muse backing Offline (the current verison will be used)
       5) any other published Musings and tag:
           muse backing SimJob MDC2020a
               or
           muse backing SimJob (where the current verison will be used)

       Note: A backing link is to a Muse working directory and all the repos
       in that working dir will be available in building and running

       <options>

       -r, --rm  : remove existing link
